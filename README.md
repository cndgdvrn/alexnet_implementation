Alexnet application with Cifar-10 dataset

# AlexNet Implementation
Here, the CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using the TensorFlow library. CIFAR-10 is a dataset that contains
60000 color images of 10 different classes, each of size 32x32 pixels. The dataset is split into training
and test sets, and the cifar10.load_data() function is used to load the training and test images and
labels. Additionally, the labels are transformed using the one-hot-encoding method with the
to_categorical function.

# Which algorithms is used???
The algorithms used in this implementation are convolution (Conv2D) and pooling
(MaxPooling2D) layers, dense (Dense) layers, normalization (BatchNormalization) and
dropout techniques.
